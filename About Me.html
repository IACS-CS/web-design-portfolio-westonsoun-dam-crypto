          <p>I am a senior in high school who enjoys sketching, creating, and designing things. I'm learning web design—HTML, CSS, and JavaScript—through class projects and personal experiments, and I'm especially interested in responsive layouts and accessible design.</p>
          <p>My portfolio includes projects like a Choose Your Own Adventure site, a Business Card project, and a CSS Zen Garden adaptation. I enjoy trying new ideas, collaborating with classmates, and improving my skills by building small, hands-on projects.</p>
