          This project consisted of choosing a small problem with many 
          solutions to create a story that would lead to us testing our 
          skills in opening new webpages and more.

        <p>
          During this project we had to create a business card 
          about a fake business. I actually had a busniness
          idea from a social account I had made in the past
          so I based my card off of that.

        <p>
          Fix me... you can add a list of sources you used to create your
          portfolio here. Be sure to acknowledge any images, fonts, or other
          media you used that you did not create yourself.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition, remember if you use AI to help (including Copilot), you
          must acknowledge it here with a description of how you used AI &mdash;
          you can list tasks AI helped you with, and you should also include
          notes <em>in your source code</em> describing any AI-generated code.
